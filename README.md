What does it do?
----------------

This extensions offers a plugin to perform A/B testing of content elements. You can configure a pool of content elements to be shown and how many content elements should be shown at a time. The elements are evenly shown. A user gets the same elements shown every time he visits the page again till the configured expire time is met. After that the procedure starts again which means a new set from the content elements is selected for the user.
